* Haskell Chess is a collection of Haskell modules that implement most      *
* aspects of the board game Chess. Basically we provide a move generator    *
* (finding all possible next moves) and a minimax algorithm (computing the  *
* best move up to a particular depth of the game tree).                     *
* The program solves simple mate problems. By now it plays both Black and   *
* White, however it can easily extended to also play against human players. *
